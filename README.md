# Sprint 12 - Project description
The Model Fitness gym chain is developing a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data.

One of the most common problems that gymns and other services face is the client churn. How do you know if a client is not with you anymore? I can calculate the churn based on people getting rid of their accounts or not renewing their contracts. However, sometimes it is not obvious that a client has left, they sneak out.

Turnover indicators vary from area to area. If an user rarely buys from an online store but in a regular basis, you can't say he is a runner. But, if for two weeks they did not open the channel that is updated daily, that is a reason to worry: your follower may have gotten bored and left you.

For a gym, makes sense to say that the clients had left if they disappeard for a month. Of course, it is possible that they are in Cancun and will come back to the gym when they return, but this is not a common situation. Normaly if a client joins, comes a couple times then disappear, he probably won't come back.

Instead of fighting churn rates, Model Fitness digitalized part of their clients profile. My job is to analyse this information and come up with a retention strategy.

To do so I must:

- learn to predict the churn probability (for the next month) for each client.
- Draw up profiles of typical users: select the most striking groups and describe their main characteristics
- Analyse the factors that most impact the churn
- Take basic conclusions and develop recommendations about how to improve the clients service:
- Identify target groups
- suggest measurements to diminish churning
- Describe any other patter that I might see regardint the interactions with clients
